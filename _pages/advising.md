## Undergraduate Research

I am interested in working with students on projects involving CS education and gamification.  Reach out to discuss options!

## Graduate Research

I do not currently advising graduate student research.  Potential graduate students should direct questions to the department.  Further, graduate students in our department go through a rotation through various faculty members.  And I am not someone that can assist with this.
