## Undergraduate Research

I am interested in working with students on projects involving CS education and gamification.  Reach out to discuss options!  I hope to have some more options posted before the spring 2024 semester.

## Graduate Research

I currently do not advise or sponsor graduate students or graduate research.  If you are a potential graduate student, please direct your questions to the CS department.
