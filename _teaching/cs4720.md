Mobile computing devices have become ubiquitous in our communities. In this course, we focus on the creation of mobile solutions for various modern platforms, including major mobile operating systems. Topics include mobile device architecture, programming languages, software engineering, user interface design, and app distribution.

## Course Objectives

Our course is an introductory course in mobile application development. We will focus on both the unique nature of building apps for mobile devices, including challenges with usability, privacy, and third-party integration.

Upon completion of this course students will:

- Understand the differences in building applications for mobile devices as opposed to desktop or the web;
- Understand the basic technology and platforms for mobile development;
- Understand the software engineering concepts necessary to develop mobile apps (and other large systems) in a group;
- Understand the privacy, ethical, usability, and accessibility issues specific to mobile;
- Have a familiarity with at least one mobile platform and programming language.
