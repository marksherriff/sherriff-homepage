The Designing Empirical Education Research Studies (DEERS) project is an NSF-funded grant geared to help faculty learn how to better perform empirical scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) studies in their classrooms. Every summer, we invite computing faculty to apply for the DEERS Workshop, where we work with faculty on designing their research projects that they then perform during the next academic year.

The educational material on this site was created from the material generated for both the in-person and virtual versions of the DEERS Workshop. Some of the material here is insipired by “Engaging in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning” by Bishop-Clark and Dietz-Uhler, which we highly recommend to anyone interested in engaging in SoTL work.
