title: "A Systematic Literature Review of Empiricism and Norms of Reporting in Computing Education Research Literature"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ACM-TOCE-2022
excerpt: 'The goal of this study is to characterize the reporting of empiricism in Computing Education Research literature by identifying whether publications include content necessary for researchers to perform replications, meta-analyses, and theory building. We answer three research questions related to this goal: RQ1) What percentage of papers in CER venues have some form of empirical evaluation? RQ2) Of the papers that have empirical evaluation, what are the characteristics of the empirical evaluation? RQ3) Of the papers that have empirical evaluation, do they follow norms (both for inclusion and for labeling of information needed for replication, meta-analysis, and, eventually, theory-building) for reporting empirical work?'
